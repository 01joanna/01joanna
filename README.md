I’m Johanna Cuevas, I develop & design digital tools and websites. I’m especially interested in React, Java, Clean Code, and TypeScript, and I love building things that are useful for people and can set new ways to create website pages.

Currently, I’m looking for new opportunities to contribute as a Frontend Engineer.
